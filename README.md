My portfoilio:
This is a project with three web pages that display my personal portfolio which includes one index page, one biography page and one resume page. These web pages only use html and css in programming. 

Three html files:
index.html bio.html resume.html 

Two stylesheets:
stylesheet_general.css stylesheet_resume.css 

One picture:

1. I think all aspects of work are properly implemented. I include all the required information in my web page and I only used css stylesheet for styling. I used more than 5 rules in my stylesheet and I did not use absolute URL for images. The index page is also redirected to my github page and all the other files are readable for others. 

2. I basically work alone for this project and I've asked question about the link of index page to TA Vincent.

3. I spent around 8 or 9 hours on this project. I spent most of my time learning and finding the proper style element for CSS, especially with the link and the position of all the elements. I had a lot of fun learning the CSS rules in styling my page.
